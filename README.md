# C Practice Files ðŸ“˜

This repo is a collection of C programs I wrote during class projects and practice sessions. It covers core topics like:

- Input/output
- Loops & conditionals
- Functions
- Arrays & pointers
- Structs
- Modular programming

These files are for learning and personal reference.
